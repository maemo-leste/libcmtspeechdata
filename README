Introduction
============

This package provides the "libcmtspeechdata" library. Libcmtspeechdata
provides an application interface for implementing the speech data
path for cellular voice calls. The library depends on other components
for setting up and managing the call signaling path.

This README file provides information about available environment
variables and other similar runtime aspects affecting applications
that use libcmtpseechdata.

Usage
=====

This section provides information for running applications
that use libcmtspeechdata.

Usage: common environment variables
-----------------------------------

CMTSPEECHDEBUG <string>
    Enable and/or disable built-in traces in components using
    the cmtspeech tracing interface (sal_debug.h). The value 
    is a comma-separated list of tracing options. Currently
    supported options are "io" (very low volume, version info, 
    some statistics, warnings and error messages), "trace" (low volume, 
    key state changes and resource management), "debug" (possibly very
    high volume, enough message to get full understanding what is
    happening) and "token" (alternative for 'debug', allows to debug
    low-level execution with a much lower tracing overhead; a single
    characther per event is printed out to stderr). Prefixing the token 
    with "no" will disable the trace type. E.g. 
    "CMTSPEECHDEBUG=info,trace,nodebug,token". Note that some or all of 
    the debugging options may be disabled at compile time and thus cannot 
    be reactived during runtime.

Usage: cmtspeech_dummy backend variables
----------------------------------------

DUMMYSRC <string>
    Select the source for generated speech frames. Supported options
    are "sine" (default, generate a sine tone), or a file name (path
    must start with either "/" or "."). If a file input is used, 
    following restrictions apply: Due to real-time requirements, 
    the whole file must be read to memory before processing starts (e.g. 
    available memory sets  the practical limit for file length). The file 
    must be a raw 8/16bit, mono, PCM audio file (with little-endian byte 
    order).

Utilities
=========

utils/cmtspeech_ofono_test.c
----------------------------

A test app that serves as a minimal example of an app using 
libcmtspeechdata with oFono integration for call signaling. It
listens for oFono call signaling on DBus system bus. When a call
is established, it sets up the voice path with libcmtspeechdata,
and loops downlink audio as-is to uplink. Remote party will get its
uplink looped back.

Limitations: as uplink timing is not corrected, so this may not work with 
all modem modes.

utils/cmtspeech_ramp_test.c
---------------------------

Test app to verify low-level communication is working towards
the modem. Implementation is based on the libcmtspeechdata 
cmtspeech_test_data_ramp_req() interface.

Limitations: very few modems (and firmwares) support this interface.

utils/send_cmtspeech_reset.c
----------------------------

Opens modem speech path with libcmtspeechdata and requests reset
with cmtspeech_state_change_error().

Notes for Debian on n900:

Optional recording is provided. Use 

aplay -f  S16_LE /data/tmp/sink.raw
aplay -f  S16_LE /data/tmp/source.raw

--

To note real call quality, use:

aplay -c 2 -r 4000 -f  S16_LE /data/tmp/source.raw

tail -c 200000 < /data/tmp/sink.raw | aplay -f  S16_LE -
